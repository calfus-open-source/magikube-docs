### Prerequisites for setting up a cluster with magikube on AWS
Before you can set up a cluster with magikube, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Ensure you have your AWS credentials ready.
2. Follow the instructions in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) to generate your AWS Access Key and Secret Key.
3. Once you have your AWS Access Key and Secret Key, install the AWS CLI on your local machine. Refer to the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) for detailed instructions.
4. Configure your AWS profile on your local machine using the following command:
```bash
aws configure --profile <profile_name>
```
5. Create a GitHub personal access token by following the instructions in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic). Ensure that the *delete_repo*, *user*, *admin:org*  and *workflow* permission is enabled for the generated token.
6. Have the GitHub organization name ready where you want the repositories to be created. If no organization is specified, repositories will be created under the executing userâ€™s account.
7. In order to run magikube and deploy application, you would need a domain name which is registered in AWS route 53. Follow [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html) for Domain resgitration.
